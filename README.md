# Obsidian Plugin Starter

This is a starter plugin for Obsidian. Making it easier for me to build plugins but you can use it to get started.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Edit manifest.json and main.ts
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
4. Run `npm run build` to build the plugin
5. Copy the `main.js` file to your Obsidian plugins folder
6. Restart Obsidian or get the hot-reload plugin.
